# Jira-Version-Report-Script

I built this tool to generate Jira-style Version Reports because I've found these graphs simply invaluable in my work, but Jira doesn't offer this feature for "team-managed projects." 

Version Reports let you visualize the progress your team is making on a software project.
You can see the following and how each has changed over time:
- the total estimated scope of the project
- the total amount of work completed
- the % of tickets you've tagged as part of the project but haven't estimated yet

This is critical to project management becasue there are only three things you have control over:
- the scope of the work (what's required?)
- the date by which it must be delivered (when do I need it?)
- the rate of work (how many engineers do I have?)

Yes, I used ChatGPT to help me build this - to speed up development, as well as practice using ChatGPT professionally.
